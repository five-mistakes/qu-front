# SmartQ Front-end

### Run front-end

In order for front-end to function properly, you need to run the [SmartQ backend](https://github.com/five-mistakes/qu-backend) on your machine.

Install dependencies:
- `npm install`
- `npm start` - this will start the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To build the front-end for production:
- `npm run build` - this will create a build folder with bundled static files.

To run the fullstack application with backend, please refer [SmartQ backend](https://github.com/five-mistakes/qu-backend).
